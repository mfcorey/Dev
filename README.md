# So, you're new here..
Hello! You have somehow discovered my hidden corner of the multiverse. 

I am glad that you made it, but want to explain who I am and why I am here to help you. 

## Who me? 

Today I am fortunate to tell that you that I am a cybersecurity analyst with my first year under my belt. 

I acknowledge that this doesn't make me an expert, however, I am here to share what I have learned thus far. 

This is my first crack at this type of thing, so buckle up for errors!
