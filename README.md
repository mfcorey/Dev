I am glad that you made it, but want to explain who I am and why I am here to help you. 

## Who are you?

My name is Corey Rader. I have been working as an information security analyst for 1 year. I have previous experience with working as a systems engineer, systems administrator, and on a service desk. 

I have always had a passion for Cybersecurity and want to share my journey in hopes that it helps someone else achieve their dream.

## Anyone Can Do This.

I firmly believe that anyone can work in this field. If I told you that you did not need to go to college, or land an exclusive internship to achieve your goal, would you believe me? â€“That is exactly what I am here to tell you.

## Roles Within InfoSec.

Classic documentation and study materials make it seem like these are very strict and rigid roles for cybersecurity, but really, we can boil it down to two: offensive and defensive*. 
*In some cases, you may find yourself working both sides of the ball.

Offensive: these are your Red Teamers, Pen testers, exploit developers and web/application testers. 
Defensive: vulnerability manager, Threat intelligence analyst, compliance analyst.

These are the most in-demand cyber roles according to LinkedIn (2023): 

Security Engineer: This role is responsible for designing and implementing security solutions, such as firewalls, antivirus, encryption, and authentication, and testing their effectiveness and performance.

Information Security Analyst: This role is responsible for monitoring and analyzing the network traffic, systems, and devices, looking for suspicious or malicious activities, and alerting the security team and other stakeholders.

Cybersecurity Engineer: This role is responsible for leading and conducting offensive tests, such as penetration testing, exploit development, and web and mobile application testing. This role also collaborates with the security team and other stakeholders to improve the detection and response capabilities of the organization.
Cybersecurity Manager: This role is responsible for overseeing and managing the cybersecurity program, planning and executing covert operations, measuring performance quality, and reporting the findings and recommendations to the organization.
Threat Intelligence Analyst: This role is responsible for researching and collecting information on current and emerging cyber threats, such as threat actors, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and providing actionable intelligence and recommendations to the security team and the organization.
